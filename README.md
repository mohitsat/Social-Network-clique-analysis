# Social-Network-clique-analysis
Analysis of a user's social circle to find user cliques

Exceution Instructions:
Please execute the code file mmsatar2.py as you would execute any normal python code, i.e., 'python mmsatar2.py'.

The libraries I have imported look something like this in the program:
	import networkx as nx
	from collections import defaultdict
	import sys
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


The program would require the entire egonets folder, and the features.txt file to execute.

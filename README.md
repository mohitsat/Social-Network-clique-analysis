# Social-Network-clique-analysis
Analysis of a user's social circle to find user cliques

The data of a user's social circles has been utilized to analyse the correctness of the hypothesis that most of the user's social circle is formed up of people from their school, university or their work. The social circle of a user would be all the connections the user has. The network formed in such a manner would be including connections from the usual places where the user may be present at. Logically, any human spends time at school, university and work for most of their lives. So, we form this hypothesis to show our basis of work.

Execution Instructions:
Please execute the code file mmsatar2.py as you would execute any normal python code, i.e., 'python mmsatar2.py'.

The libraries I have imported look something like this in the program:
	import networkx as nx; 
	from collections import defaultdict; 
	import sys; 
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; 


The program would require the entire egonets folder, and the features.txt file to execute which has been provided in the project structure.
